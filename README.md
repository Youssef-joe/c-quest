C-Quest: Object-Oriented Programming Learning Platform
C-Quest is an interactive educational platform designed to teach Object-Oriented Programming principles through engaging, story-driven coding challenges. The application features seven progressively complex levels that cover essential OOP concepts including encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism, and interfaces.

Players tackle real-world scenarios presented as quests, from securing a leaky bank vault to building a complete e-commerce system. Each level includes starter code, validation rules that provide instant feedback, and detailed hints to guide learners through the problem-solving process. The platform tracks progress through an experience point system and provides immediate success/failure messages to reinforce learning outcomes.

Built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, C-Quest combines a modern web interface with an accessible code editor to create an engaging learning environment that demonstrates why object-oriented design patterns matter in professional software development.
